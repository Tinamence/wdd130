         From prescription opioids to illicit substances like heroin, these drugs pose serious risks that extend beyond physical health, influencing the overall well-being
        and future prospects of young individuals. This essay explores the detrimental effects of narcotic drugs on youth, encompassing both immediate dangers
        and long-term consequences.Addiction and Dependence: One of the most pressing issues is the high potential for addiction and dependence associated with narcotic drugs. 
        Youthful experimentation can swiftly spiral into a cycle of dependence, leading to detrimental effects on physical health.
        Risk of Overdose: The potency of narcotic drugs increases the risk of overdose, a life-threatening event that can have immediate consequences.
